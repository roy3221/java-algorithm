//Longest Monotonic Subsequence in 2D
//There is a hypothesis floating around that SAT score is a strong indicator of GPA. Your task is to provide the strongest counter example for this hypothesis. Given a data set of (sat, gpa) for the final year of a group of students, devise an algorithm to construct the longest sequence of (sati, gpai) of students with progressively better SAT scores, and progressively worse gpa’s, i.e. sat1 < sat2 < … < satk and gpa1 > gpa2 > … > gpak ( Assume SAT scores and gpa’s are unique )
//Please submit your code as a file in the language of your choice. Please add a description of your algorithm either in a comment in the code, or in the Message box below.
